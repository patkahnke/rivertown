				<h3>What we do</h3>
					<p>Rivertown Communications excels at creating effective e-learning and video based training courses using the content and knowledge your organization already has or we can develop new material using our experts. We develop training that helps your employees, affiliates and learners become more effective. We begin by meeting with your staff to listen to your needs and to identify the content for your training. Our goal is to make sure the time and resources you dedicate to your training program is 100% effective.<p>
					<p>Our instructional designers will write custom lessons targeted to your precise needs and our graphics designers and video professionals will create the visual elements to best illustrate the training. Our programmers will combine all elements into an e-Learning program or video production that is available to your audience 24/7. If desired, testing and learner tracking can be integrated into the training modules to measure progress and certify mastery. Rivertown Communications will work with your staff every step of the way and your team can be involved as little or as much as desired.</p>
